    <p>The window object represents the browser window.
        The document object represents the HTML document loaded in that window.
        
        The window object has many useful properties like the location object and the setTimeout function.
        
        Since the window object is the Global object, ergo, it is the end of all scope chains, you don’t have to explicitly specify it when accessing its properties…
        Instead of window.setTimeout, you can just write setTimeout</p>
